## 6. Key design decisions and trade-offs

### 6.1. Custom IR, not `SyntaxTreeNode`
markdown-it-py's `SyntaxTreeNode` doesn't guarantee round-trip stability and
is hard to extend with custom YFM nodes. We use a flat-token → custom IR
conversion in `markdown_parser.py`, plus pydantic for serialization.

### 6.2. Round-trip stability is "idempotent after one pass"
Byte-identical round-trip on arbitrary markdown is impossible. Contract:

> `render(parse(text))` may normalize formatting (spaces inside table cells,
> list marker style, headings), but `render(parse(render(parse(text))))`
> **must equal** `render(parse(text))`.

Enforced by every round-trip test.

### 6.3. Table cell pipe escaping
A literal `|` inside a table cell (e.g. `string \| list of strings`) must be
written as `\|`. Otherwise on the second parse pass markdown-it would split the
cell, drop the extra column, and lose data. Fixed in `_escape_table_cell`.
**Bug discovered on real file `auth.md`**, fixed in step 2.4.

### 6.4. YFM block plugins use `state.md.block.tokenize` for inner content
For containers like `{% note %}` and `{% list tabs %}`, we register a block
rule, find the matching closing tag (with nesting support), then call
markdown-it's own block tokenizer on the inner lines. This makes nested
constructs work for free.

### 6.5. `{{ variable }}` is an inline rule registered before `text`
This guarantees recognition before plain text consumes the braces.
`code_inline` and `fence` are not re-tokenized by markdown-it, so
`{{ name }}` inside `` `code` `` stays literal — verified by tests.

### 6.6. Source-mutating preprocessing for variables in URLs and image sizes
Two plugins use `core.ruler.before("normalize")` preprocessing to rewrite the
source before markdown-it tokenizes it, then `core.ruler.after("inline")` to
restore the original semantics on the resulting tokens:

- **link_with_variable**: rewrites `{{ var }}` inside `[...](...)` URLs to a
  URL-safe placeholder (`yfmvar-N-yfmvarend`), restores on
  `link_open.href` / `image.src` attributes.
- **image_size**: strips ` =WxH` from inside `![alt](src ...)`, stashes the
  size in `state.env`, attaches to image token as `meta.width` / `meta.height`.

Placeholders use alphanumerics + dashes only — valid URL chars; markdown-it
never interprets them.

### 6.7. Term references vs ordinary links
Term refs `[*name]` are inline tokens registered **before** `link` in the
inline ruler. They match only when the second character is `*`. Ordinary links
`[text](url)` are unaffected.

### 6.8. Unclosed YFM tags don't crash
If `{% note ... %}` lacks `{% endnote %}`, the rule returns `False` and the
opening line falls back to a plain paragraph. Tests verify this for every
container construct.

### 6.9. Globally unique placeholder counters per segment
See §5.4. The counter and placeholder list are kept in a shared
`_ProtectState` passed by reference through recursion in
`protect_inline`. Without this, nested constructs (link inside strong)
would reuse `⟦L1⟧` and collisions in the restore map would silently swap
links.

### 6.10. Mixed-type `ast_path` for re-insertion
For most nodes, `ast_path` is a list of int indices into `.children`. For
tables and tabs, we use typed string markers (`"header"`, `"row"`,
`"title"`) because their internal structure is not a flat children list:

- Table cell: `[..., "header", col_idx]` or `[..., "row", row_idx, col_idx]`.
- Tab title: `[..., tab_idx, "title"]`.
- Tab body block N: `[..., tab_idx, N]` (descend into `YfmTab.children`).

`_navigate_to_doc_index` in `reinsert.py` walks only int steps; typed-string
paths are decoded in `_set_inline_at_ast_path` per segment kind.

### 6.11. Hybrid LLM I/O strategy (Phase C/D)
Yandex AI Studio's OpenAI-compatible endpoint **does not support
`response_format={"type":"json_object"}`** (verified via documentation and
smoke test). We therefore use:

- **Translator**: JSON I/O. Smoke test (yandexgpt-5.1, deepseek-v32) shows
  models reliably return valid JSON when the prompt says "Return ONLY a JSON
  object". YandexGPT wraps in ` ```...``` ` fences sometimes; we strip them.
- **Critic**: JSON I/O. Returns `{verdict, issues}` schema.
- **Fallback** (if JSON parsing fails 3x): retry with delimited format
  `<<<S0001>>>...<<<END>>>`. Not implemented in MVP; in backlog.

### 6.12. Per-PR cache (intra-PR only)
Within a single PR run, identical segment texts (e.g. boilerplate paragraphs
included in multiple files) are translated once. The cache key is
`hash(text + path_context + role)`. Cache is in-memory only, discarded after
the run. No cross-PR cache.

### 6.13. Sequential files, parallel batches within file
Files are processed sequentially (predictable cost reporting, easier debug).
Batches inside a file are sent in parallel via `asyncio.gather` with a
concurrency limit of 3. This gives 3–5x speedup for large files without
overwhelming Yandex AI Studio.

### 6.14. Partial failure handling
If retries are exhausted for a segment/file:
- **Skip the file, continue with the rest of the PR.**
- Mark in the report: "Not translated due to API error".
- Translation PR is still created with the files that succeeded.
- This is preferred over failing the whole job (a single API hiccup
  shouldn't kill a 50-file PR).

### 6.15. Why config is YAML, not TOML
v1 used TOML. v2 uses YAML because the config has nested structures (per-role
models with fallback chains) and YAML is more readable for that. Migration is
trivial — there are only a handful of keys.

### 6.16. Why the Memory Bank is so verbose

This project is co-developed by the human owner and an AI assistant across many
chat sessions. Context loss between sessions is a real risk. The Memory Bank is
the canonical handover document. Verbosity is intentional.

Since post-D.2 it is split into [`docs/memory-bank/`](../../MEMORY_BANK.md)
parts; [`MEMORY_BANK.md`](../../MEMORY_BANK.md) at the repo root is the index.

### 6.17. TOC and redirect YAML — strict PR scope (not whole-file rewrite)

Diplodoc navigation files (`toc.yaml`, `toc*.yaml`, redirect/preservation YAML)
must **not** be fully re-translated on every PR. Only entries **changed in the
source PR** may be updated in the EN mirror.

**Problem:** A naive "translate the whole YAML" pass can (a) add EN menu items
for RU-only pages outside the PR, (b) drop EN-only legacy entries, or (c)
re-translate unchanged labels and drift from EN-main wording.

**Scope detection (RU base vs RU PR head):**

| File kind | Scope key | In scope when |
|---|---|---|
| TOC | `href` | New item, or existing item whose Russian `name` changed |
| Redirects | `from` | New entry, or existing entry whose `to` target changed |

Implementation: `navigation/toc.py` (`toc_translate_scope`, `merge_en_toc_yaml`,
`validate_toc_merge`) and `navigation/redirects.py` (same pattern).

**Merge rules (both kinds):**

1. **Unchanged key, already in EN-main** → keep EN block verbatim (no LLM).
2. **Key in scope** → take structure/value from RU PR; translate label (`name`)
   or copy `to` (redirects are usually language-neutral).
3. **RU-only key outside scope** → **skip** (do not invent EN entries).
4. **RU removed key** → omit from output (mirror RU PR structure).
5. **EN-only legacy key not in RU PR** → append unchanged at end.

This is **stricter than v1** (`main:toc_yaml.py`), which used `new_hrefs` (basenames
of newly translated `.md` files). v2 adds diff-based scope so **title-only**
changes on existing pages are picked up even when the `.md` basename was already
known. Orchestrator (Phase F) should union: `new_hrefs` ∪ `toc_translate_scope()`.

**Phase E hook:** `validate_toc_merge` / `validate_redirect_merge` flag
`unexpected_*`, `missing_*`, and `scope_not_applied` for the report.

**Phase F/G (workflow glue — TBD):** After per-file `.md` translation, if PR
touches `toc*.yaml` or redirect YAML, run scoped merge against EN-main + RU PR
head; write result to the paired EN path. Do **not** run merge for navigation
files outside the PR diff.

> **Status (2025-05):** merge/validate **APIs are implemented and tested**
> (`merge_en_toc_yaml`, `merge_en_redirects_yaml`, `validate_*`,
> `validate_navigation_merge_warnings`). **Not yet wired** into
> `pipeline/orchestrator.py` or `github/workflow.py` — markdown-only today.

Tests: `tests/unit/test_navigation_toc.py`, `test_navigation_redirects.py`,
`test_navigation_paths.py`, `test_validation_heuristics.py`.

### 6.18. Translation branch always on upstream (fork PRs)

**Problem:** Pushing `ydbdoc-review/pr-N` to the contributor fork (PR head repo)
requires write access to someone else's fork. GitHub Actions `GITHUB_TOKEN` only
has write on the upstream repo (`ydb-platform/ydb`), so fork pushes fail with
`permission denied`.

**Decision:**

1. **Fetch** source content from the PR head remote (fork or same-repo) when
   building the translation branch.
2. **Push** the translation branch always to upstream (`repo_https_clone_url`).
3. **Open translation PR** on upstream with `head=ydbdoc-review/pr-N` and
   `base=translation_pr_base(ctx)`:
   - same-repo source PR → base = source head branch (stacked PR);
   - fork source PR → base = source PR base branch (`main`, etc.) because the
     contributor feature branch does not exist on upstream.

Helpers: `is_fork_head`, `translation_pr_base`, `repo_https_clone_url` in
`github/pr.py`. See **07-pipeline** §16.3.
